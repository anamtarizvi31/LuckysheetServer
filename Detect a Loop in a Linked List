Question:
How do you detect if a linked list has a cycle?

Answer:
Use Floyd’s Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare) algorithm.

def hasCycle(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
